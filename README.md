**Reinforcement Learning Project: Treasure Hunt**

In this repo there are two different jupyter notebooks:
  1) EECS738-Project4.ipynb : In this file I followed the tutorial in the Getting AI smarter with Q-learning article. I used this as a starting place to get a better understand of how q-learning works. 
  2) EECS738-ReinforcementLearning.ipynb : In this file I created my own maze still using q-learing. I used what I learned from the tutorial in the other notebook and looking at the Introduction to Q Learning article to make my maze. 

## Goal of Project: 
Formulate ideas on how reinforcement learning can be used to find treasure efficiently while avoiding obstacles and opponents, and build one or more reinforcement policies to model situational assessments, actions and rewards programmatically

## Approach:
Gererally, my approach for this project was to implement Q-learning to solve the optimal path for the maze. More specific details are discussed in the notebook.
